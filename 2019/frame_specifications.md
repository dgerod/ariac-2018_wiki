# Details of Products specified in Orders
This page outlines the specifications of the pose requirements specified in each Order.

As outlined in the [competition specifications](./competition_specifications), an Order specifies a list of products to be put into each shipment.
Each product has a specified type and required position and orientation in the shipping box.

As specified on the [competition interface](./competition_interface_documentation) page, Orders are communicated to teams with the `osrf_gear/Order` ROS message.

## Type of the product
The type of the product is specified as its product name, such as `gear_part` or `piston_rod_part`.
The availability of these products in the workcell may be determined by querying the `material_locations` ROS service as specified [in this tutorial](./tutorials/gear_interface).

## Pose of the product in the shipping box
The pose of the product is composed of the position and the orientation of the product **specified in the reference frame of the tray**.
It is communicated in a [geometry_msgs/Pose](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Pose.html) message.

### Frame of the tray
The following image depicts the frame of the kit tray on AGV1.
The x, y, and z axes are represented by red, green and blue markers, respectively.
It has a `gear_part` with its origin at `(x, y, z) = (0, 0.15, 0)` (units in meters) and a `piston_rod_part` at `(0.1, -0.2, 0)`.
Both parts have an orientation of `(roll, pitch, yaw) = (0, 0, 0)` (units in radians) with respect to the frame of the tray.

The following image shows the kit tray on AGV1 with two parts on it. In this case,`gear_part` has a position `(x, y, z) = (0, 0.15, 0)` (units in meters) and an orientation `(roll, pitch, yaw) = (0, 0, 1.57)` (units in radians). `Piston_rod_part` has a position `(x, y, z) = (0.1, -0.2, 0)` and an orientation `(roll, pitch, yaw) = (0, 0, 1.57)`.

The following image shows the same as above but for AGV2.
Note that the parts still have an orientation of `(0, 0, 0)` with respect to the frame of the tray, but since the frame itself has a different orientation compared to AGV1, the parts are rotated.

### Frame of the product
The pose of the product in the workcell environment will vary over time as the product is moved.
The frame of each product is typically at the center of the product: it can be visualized by clicking on the product in the simulated workcell environment and pressing `t`: this will display the axes of the frame of the product.

The following figure shows the frame of the `gear_part`, with the x, y and z axes represented by red, green and blue markers, respectively.

Not all parts have the frame origin at their center: the `piston_rod_part`, for example, has the origin of its frame off-center, as shown in the following figure.

### Flipped products

An order could contain a product that requires to be flipped, in which case the requested `roll` for the product will be specified as pi. The `pulley_part` is the only product in the environment designed to be flippable. It has a flat collision surface on its top and bottom ends making it ideal for grasping it with a vacuum gripper. However, the side of the product is hollow, creating a more difficult grasp because of the small contact patch that the edges provide. Teams are not permitted to directly grasp this product from the side when a product flip is required.

### Determining the product pose in the tray programmatically
The logical camera reports the pose of products and shipping boxes with respect to the pose of the camera.
See the [sensor interface tutorial](./tutorials/sensor_interface) for details of how to use this sensor to programmatically determine the pose of products on the trays.

Other sensors can also be used if combined with perception algorithms.
Note that some parts have a raised mark on them so that their orientation can be detected.
