| Trial name | Scenario type | Description | Details | Order images |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| final01 | Baseline shipment building | One order of two shipments. | Two faulty piston rods and two faulty gaskets.| [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final01.jpg) |
| final02 | Baseline shipment building | Flipped products, order update. | Products must be removed after the order update. Order will update once the first order is complete. Two flipped pulleys in updated order. One pulley flipped and rotated. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final02.jpg), [updated order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final02_updated_order.jpg) |
| final03 | Baseline shipment building | Two shipments. Updated order is a subset of the original order, which means there are then enough products available. | Two faulty gaskets. Updates after three wanted products. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final03.jpg), [updated order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final03_updated_order.jpg) |
| final04 | Baseline shipment building | Flipped products, sensor blackout. | Two faulty piston rods. Blackout triggered after one product. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final04.jpg) |
| final05 | Baseline shipment building | Updated order triggered during sensor blackout. Two shipments. | Faulty piston rods. Sensor blackout and order update will trigger after two products placed in box. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final05.jpg), [updated order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final05_updated_order.jpg) |
| final06 | Dropped products | Two shipments. Retrievable product drops over bins (2). | Not perfectly completable because of faulty piston rod. One piston rod and one disk drops in bins. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final06.jpg) |
| final07 | Dropped products | Unreachable drops (2) makes order impossible to complete. | Gear and piston rod drop to ground. Faulty disk part. Only one usable part. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final07.jpg) |
| final08 | Dropped products | Product in bins gets dropped within reach. Product dropped outside of shipping box must be retrieved for full points. | Gear drops either to the left or the right of the shipping box. Gasket drops in bin. Faulty disk parts. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final08.jpg) |
| final09 | Dropped products | Dropped product occurs during sensor blackout. Product dropped in shipping box must be repositioned for full points. | Sensor blackout and order update triggered after two products. Gasket and disk (from updated order) dropped into shipping box. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final09.jpg), [updated order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final09_updated_order.jpg) |
| final10 | Dropped products | Dropped product occurs during sensor blackout. Product(s) dropped in the bins during the blackout land upside-down and should be flipped/avoided/used anyway. | Sensor blackout and order update triggered after two products. Gear drops either to the left or the right of the storage bin. Back disk drops, front disk faulty (better to use the flipped disk). | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final10.jpg), [updated order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final10_updated_order.jpg) |
| final11 | High-priority order change | Second order requiring different products to the first order. Not enough non-faulty products available to fill both orders. | Second order triggered after three products are used. Better to use non-faulty piston rods in the high-priority order. Second order requires a pulley to be flipped (one pulley is faulty). | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final11.jpg), [high priority order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final11_new_order.jpg) |
| final12 | High-priority order change | Second order reusing most of the first order. Not enough non-faulty products available to fill both orders. | Second order triggered after three products are used. One disk and two gears can be reused in the second order. Better to use non-faulty gears in high-priority order. | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final12.jpg), [high priority order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final12_new_order.jpg) |
| final13 | High-priority order change | Second order not reusing products from the first order, issued during sensor blackout. Flipped pulley in second order. | | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final13.jpg), [high priority order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final13_new_order.jpg) |
| final14 | High-priority order change | Second order reusing most products from the first order, issued during sensor blackout. Products must be repositioned to be used in the second order. | | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final14.jpg), [high priority order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final14_new_order.jpg) |
| final15 | High-priority order change | Second order requiring the same products as the first order. Not enough products available to fill both orders. | | [Initial order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final15.jpg), [high priority order](https://bytebucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/img/finals_orders/final15_new_order.jpg) |
