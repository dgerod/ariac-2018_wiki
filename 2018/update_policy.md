# Policy for updates to the ARIAC software

Additional challenges are progressively released in the ARIAC software as qualification tasks get successively more difficult.

When changes that will affect participants' code are introduced, the [ARIAC updates page](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2018/updates) will list the change.

## During the Finals
The final version of the ARIAC software will be released in advance of the competition Finals so that participants can test their code against that version of the software.
Changes will not be released into the software after it has been declared 'final', so that teams can test with the exact version used during the Finals.

## During the Qualifiers
So as not to impact ARIAC participants while a qualification task is open for submissions, breaking changes will only be released into the ARIAC software once any open qualification task has closed.
However, bug fixes/behavioral corrections may be released into ARIAC software during the period that a qualification task is open for submissions.
Participants should monitor the updates page to be informed of available releases and their changes.

# Policy for updates to the ARIAC rules

Updates may be made to the rules/scoring metrics at any time throughout Qualifiers at the discretion of the competition controllers.
This includes the available sensors/costs, the permitted competition interface, submission requirements, and scoring parameters.
Where possible advanced notice of these changes is listed on the updates page.
The final rules/scoring metrics will be confirmed to teams in advance of the competition Finals.
