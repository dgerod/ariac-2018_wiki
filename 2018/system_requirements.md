# System Requirements for Running GEAR #

## Recommended system setup
In order to run GEAR we recommend your computer has:

- Modern multi-core CPU, e.g. Intel Core i5
- 8 Gb of RAM
- Discrete Graphics Card, e.g. Nvidia GTX 650
- Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 Xenial (64-bit)
- Gazebo >= 8.4.0
- ROS Kinetic

The [system setup tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ariac/2018/Tutorials/SystemSetup) details the recommended process for installing Gazebo, ROS and GEAR.

## Alternative system setups

It is possible to run GEAR inside of a virtual machine. You may need to turn off 3D/hardware acceleration.

It is possible to run GEAR on a different operating system/ROS distribution, but it is not recommended or supported.

Even if you choose an alternative system setup for development, **during the Finals, teams' software will be run on machines with Ubuntu Xenial and ROS Kinetic.** It is the only officially supported platform.
