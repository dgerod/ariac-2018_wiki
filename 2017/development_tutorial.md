1. How to do Development
    * Step through the development of simple solution (maybe with belt pausing to make easier):
        * Narrow down sensor data to desired object
        * Use location of desired object to place the arm
        * Turn on the vacuum
        * Pick object
        * Move arm somewhere else
        * Drop object (turn off vacuum)
    * Use this plot as a way to introduce several things (or point to tutorials that explain these things):
        * Build-run loop
        * build tools (cmake / catkin build)
        * rviz
        * rqt
        * Gazebo GUI (show collisions, pause and translate / rotate)
